# Wavyrun

A funny Runner / Platformer / Rythmer game created in C++ and with the help of the SFML library.
It was made for the Game Jam in 2016.

## How to use

After installing SFML [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) you will have to execute compil.sh in the source directory. `./compil.sh`

Then export the library path : `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/SFML/lib`

The binary is in the release directory, to execute it `./Wavyrun`
